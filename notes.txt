- move databoard/config_databoard.py to databoard/config.py
- add proper setup.py
- move tests in databoard/tests/ and make "nosetests databoard" work
- fix all errors obtained with 
flake8 databoard --ignore=E501,E211,E265
or just "make code-analysis"
- update readme.md to explain how to test locally
- evaluate code coverage
- remove old isotonic code. current sklearn should be fixed
- add object should be defined with:
class PredictionArrayType(object):
not
class PredictionArrayType:
- web front end / flask should be isolated from the ML/leaderboard code
- avoid the ramp_index.txt mess


in events page there should be a split between My Ramps and the others.
I always spend 20s to find the good one.

Important details:

1. Production server

- Production server deployed on prod_ramp 134.158.75.211. 
This instance built from image "test_ramp_060716". This image has been obtained by running the script tools/deploy_databoard.sh.

- Two disks are mounted to the VM:
    * sciencefs disk, which is used for backup. It is mounted to /mnt/datacamp.
    * persistent volume (prod_ramp), where databoard code and submission files are stored. It is mounted to /mnt/ramp_data.

- Databoard code is in /mnt/ramp_data/code/databoard

- Databoard submission files, fabfile.py, ... are in /mnt/ramp_data/datacamp/databoard

- Backup are made every day around midnight and are saved (on the sciencefs disk) in /mnt/datacamp/backup. It is made using cron and bash scripts in /mnt/ramp_data/code/databoard/tools/dump_db.sh + housekeeping.sh.
During RAMP, it might be better to increase the backup frequency. To do this, the crontab file can be edited by running "crontab -e".
Two types of backup:
    * dump of the database
    * rsync of /mnt/ramp_data/datacamp/databoard folder

2. Test server

- Test server deployed on test_ramp 134.158.75.119

- One disk is mounted to the VM:
    * persistent volume (test_ramp), where databoard code and submission files are stored. It is mounted to /mnt/ramp_data.

- Databoard submission files, fabfile.py, ... are in /mnt/ramp_data/datacamp/databoard

- Databoard code is in /mnt/ramp_data/code/databoard

- If you want to use databoard submission files and database of the production server, you can use the script tools/prod_db_to_test.sh from the test server. Be careful to change the name of the database dump you want to use.
