The data set was donated to us by an unnamed company handling flight ticket reservations. The data is thin, it contains
<ul>
<li> the date of departure
<li> the departure airport
<li> the arrival airport
<li> the mean and standard deviation of the number of weeks of the reservations made before the departure date
<li> a field called <code>log_PAX</code> which is related to the number of passengers (the actual number were changed for privacy reasons)
</ul>

The goal is to predict the <code>log_PAX</code> column. The prediction quality is measured by RMSE. 

The data is obviously limited, but since data and location informations are available, it can be joined to external data sets. <b>The challenge in this RAMP is to find good data that can be correlated to flight traffic</b>.
